Glucose chat is a cross platform web browser based captive portal and chat wireless ap administration system. It allows for the owner of a wireless node to administer it through the chat interface, by limiting bandwidth, blacklisting certain computers and temporarily removing others from the network. It has a gui interface as well as text based commands similar to irc chat commands. It is built on top of Openwrt wireless, using javascript, lighthttpd, php, sh, and linux IPTables.
